Here are the offsets/values that has the full info of a denpa man in tdmf so you could copy over on citra when
you want to do it in hxd without catching denpa men in a real 3ds and then copy them over from 3ds to citra
(to prevent the message about the update, which makes the game unplayable on citra if you know what i mean):
2588-264B - 1st Denpa Man (a.k.a Hero, which is the main offset to copy it on an empty spot)

2684-2747 - 2nd Denpa Man

2780-2843 - 3rd Denpa Man

287C-293F - 4th Denpa Man

2978-2A3B - 5th Denpa Man

2A74-2B37 - 6th Denpa Man

2B70-2C33 - 7th Denpa Man

2C6C-2D2F - 8th Denpa Man

(BONUS) Here's the offsets that has the personality of a denpa:
25FE-2602 - 1st Denpa Man
26FA-26FE - 2nd Denpa Man
27F6-27FA - 3rd Denpa Man
28F2-28F6 - 4th Denpa Man
29EE-29F2 - 5th Denpa Man
2AEA-2AEE - 6th Denpa Man
2BE6-2BEA - 7th Denpa Man
2CE2-2CE6 - 8th Denpa Man

And the values (listen i know i took those from my citra save):
►☺,☻H
 ♥î☻z
◄ ▼ /
 ♥'☻g
"☺9☻u
☺ ▼ ▼
" ▬☻y
►☺a☻h
 ♠♫☻r

Just at least make it different when copying those values from the 2nd denpa man to the 8th one.
