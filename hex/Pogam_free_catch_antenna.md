Ok so basically i documented offset 0 - FF on the enemy catch antenna
hex location for the first denpa for the catch enemy is 2624 (catch antenna only)

i have a theory that the same enemies that are lower on this list are stronger than the other ones on top

these are all offsets btw

these may be completely wrong there was like 150 of them
